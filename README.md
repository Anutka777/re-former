# README

Part of the [Odin Project Ruby on Rails Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-forms)

Basically the task is to build a functional *registeration form* **using pure HTML first** and then **refactor** it using the proper way - **with helper methods**.

It also shows how ```form_with(model: ...) ``` conviniently adds model-record-object in edit-view for you.
